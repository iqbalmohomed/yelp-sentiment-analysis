PyTorch implementation of LSTM and fine-tuned BERT, XLNet sequence classification models

This is a learning class project for "Deep Learning for NLP with PyTorch". Code is heavily inspired from various notebooks at https://github.com/ravi-ilango/aicamp-mar-2021

The LSTM model achieves approx 88% accuracy on the test set, while the Bert and XLNet-based models achieve 95% and 96% accuracy, respectively.
